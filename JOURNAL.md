Day 1- Saturday- 2 Hours - Liam:

Today was my first day starting off of building the H². I got the schematic pretty much done by converting deleting uneeded components from horizon v1 (our main, and big board) and fixing connections due to different chips.

Day 2- Sunday - 5 hours - Liam:

Today was my first day of major progress. I started off the day by removing the unneded chips and switching out the sensors from spi to I2C, as that is what we needed for this board. Once all that was done, I finally started the routing for the first time. I routed about half of it until I got tired for the day and ended there.

Day 3 - Monday - 4 hours - Liam:

Today I finally finishd routing all the traces for v1. This definitly took me some time as KiCad is fairly new to me and had to learn a lot of new concepts, but I eventually finished routing it for the first time. It wasn't the greatest, but it was a start. After looking at it for a few minutes, I knew that since the stakes for this board were so high, I kinda was forced to re-route it, and good thing I did. For this routing (v2), I was attempting to keep all the parts on one layer so we could put it on a hot plate, but it eneded up being very difficult.

Day 4 - Tuesday - 8 hours - 2 from Liam, and 6 from Scooter:

Liam: I decided I needed some help getting this smaller. I asked scooter to help with the final traces and he got them done! we also made a logo for the silkscreen and mounting holes. I spend a couple hours getting some of the software done while scooter finished the pcb. 


Day 5 - Thursday - 8 Hours - 3 from Liam, and 5 from scooter: 

Scooter: Today, I finally finished the pcb and finished getting the BOM created. That difinitly took me some time as every time I made it, one part needed to be changed since I found a mistake :why:... at least now it's all good! I'm hoping on submitting today too!

Liam: I did software for the LED, IMU, and Barometer. I still need to do the buzzer and NAND/SD card.
