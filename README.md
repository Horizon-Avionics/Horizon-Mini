## Building an open source flight logger

### By Scooter Y and Liam G

------

#### About:

The Goal of this project was to build a simpler datalogger for model rockets to collect the info needed for most rocketiers from multiple sensors including an IMU and Baro. We built this as a dev board so when we eventually produce the larger V1 board, we can weed out issues before spending $400.

#### Features:

- This whole board is under $50 USD.
- One ARMCortex M0+ MCU
- IMU and Barometer
- SD and NAND Datalogging

##### Checkout locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/Horizon-Avionics/Horizon-Mini`

2. Open the corresponding folder in KiCad 9.0
